esddecrypt
----------

### Description
This repository contains updated code of the original esddecrypt created by qad.
The code has been modified to be compilled using mingw.

### Motives
The only portable version of the ESD decryption program that works with 14361
and newer crypto keys has no source code available. Because of that I have
decided to modify the latest source code I could find for the original
esddecrypt to be compatible with both pre-14361 and post-14361 crypto keys.

### Original source code
The original source code by qad which was used to create this repository can
be found here: https://forums.mydigitallife.net/posts/967554

### License
The code is unlicensed since the author of the original source no longer can
be reached.
